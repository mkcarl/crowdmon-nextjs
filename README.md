# Crowdmon 

[Crowdmon](https://app.crowdmon.mkcarl.com) is a built using Next.js and MUI to provide a simple and easily accesible 
way for users to contribute in Paimon dataset collection. 

## Motivations
### Why/Who is Paimon?
[Paimon](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Paimon) is a character from Genshin Impact. There are no readily 
available datasets of Paimon, so why not. I have plans to further study about 
machine/deep learning methods using this dataset.
### Why web app? 
Web apps are easily accessible via any device with a browser. This means anyone with a mobile phone, laptop or tablet
can contribute in the dataset collection.
